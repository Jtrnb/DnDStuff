After [[The Quake]]
District-01 was never a permanent solution, with increasing numbers of biotics and machine the planets resources were consumed. The best solution was building a series of 1st generation warp ships and leave to other worlds. [[HEARTH]] started the project in 3041 to launch in 3074. 

#### The List:
The list contained an order for all persons who would be shipped off world, the list contained names of those deemed valuable or vital to society or those who could pay. Those on the list received a magical binding allowing their admission. Very few were able to bypass these bindings and many many people were left behind.

Six 1 billion person ships were launched. 6 billion more were left behind.

#### The Fall:
After the success of [[Project Antoncore - Abandonment]] phase two was enacted, destruction of District-01 and its inhabitance. Every [[HEARTH]] facility was detonated via automated explosive. Magical mines and traps activated as well as the [[!Ordained]] awakening to finish the rest of life off to allow the planet to "reset"

"No one left behind"
