Geothermal proved to be way more effective than anyone thought, magic was infused into geothermal extractors to produce 2/3rds of District-01's energy. They were created during the reign of the [[Founders Coalition]] and later moved to the control of [[HEARTH]]. 

Most of these generators were discounted once wireless energy transfer allowed power to be extracted from the sun.

After [[Project Antoncore - Abandonment]], the sun ring was no longer going to power District-01 and would be used to power other districts, better ones set up by the *real* humanity.
