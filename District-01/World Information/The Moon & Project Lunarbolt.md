Around the year 2432, the [[Founders Coalition]] started Project Lunarbolt. The idea was to convert the moon into a massive fusion reactor, using the crust of the moon as a housing. The mission was launched around 2451 and arrived on the moon the same year. The reactor was made and though wireless energy transfer seemed to work producing nearly a third of all power on District-01. 


After [[Project Antoncore - Abandonment]] the moon was forcefully detonated, leaving the reactor to rip the moon into fragments. They not orbit District-01 as a reminder of inevitability.
