A guild focused on reclaiming nature and restoring the natural balance of District-01. While the guild on the outside may appear benevolent and well treating they use shady deals to get what they need. 

To maintain order rules must be in place, people cannot stand out of line, high ranking members are more like dictators than leaders often leaving people in exile. One must follow their 5 tenets (Russian Communism)
1. Nature is King, None shall disrespect
2. Obstruction of reclamation is punishable
3. The struggle for life shall be enduring forever
4. To want for oneself is a sin
5. Property is theft.
