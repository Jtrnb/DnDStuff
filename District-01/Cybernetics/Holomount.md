Ability: As an action you may summon a holographic solid of any rideable phenomena no larger than a 15 foot cube. The solid must be in a place that you can see and be within 30 feet of you. You may not have more than one holographic solid at a time. The holographic solid has 1 hitpoint and a 15 AC, all other stats are equivalent to that of the creature mimicked. The holographic solid cannot attack. 

While you control a holographic solid, whenever you take damage or make a saving throw not related to this cybernetic, you must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the holographic solid disappears. 

As a bonus action you may command the holographic solid to mimic an action, or move. 

Overheat Ability: While this cybernetic is Overheated, as an action you may cause an existing holographic solid to explode, causing all creatures looking at it within 15 feet of it to make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw or become blinded for 1 round.
