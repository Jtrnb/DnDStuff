Ability: As an action you may summon a holographic image of any phenomena no larger than a 10 foot cube. The image must be in a place that you can see and be within 30 feet of you. The holographic image is immune to damage. You may not have more than one holographic image at a time.

While you control a holographic image, whenever you take damage or make a saving throw not related to this cybernetic, you must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or the holographic image disappears. 

As a bonus action you may command the holographic image to mimic an action, or move.
