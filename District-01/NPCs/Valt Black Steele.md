Exile of the [[Gaia's Guild]] for wanting more. Managed to escape with his life barely. traveled away from [[!Tretosavila]]. 

Swore to take control of Tretosavila, for their methods are flawed and will only result in the maintenance of this world. He seeks a better future one where man reigns above all, where humans control nature and its paths.

He started the [[Valerian Conclave]] as a way to build an army and fight the tretosavilan. After their first invasion is was clear they were undermatched and would need to take out their allies, one by one.
